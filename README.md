# SilkroadWebsite

Silkroad Online Website made with Blazor .Net 8. This project is not a priority for me so I may or may not work on it.

<h2>Pages</h2>

* News (can be added via _Posts table in SilkroadWeb database) - to be managed via Admin Panel later on.
* Download (can be added via _DownloadLinks table in SilkroadWeb database) - to be managed via Admin Panel later on.
* Ranking (Player & Guild)
* User Account creation/ Sign in (with .NET 8 Auth auto-generated)

<h2>TODO</h2>

* Modify Account creation (form & entites & tables) to include Security Code and ReCaptcha
* Create user roles (admin / user)
* Create an admin panel with normal SRO features (adding silk, banning a user etc)
* Ability to add custom rankings
* Ability to add custom pages
* Buy silk page
* Payment handling with pingback
